#
#    This program  reads the angles from the acceleromteer, gyroscope
#    and mangnetometer on a BerryIMU connected to a Raspberry Pi.
#
#    Both the BerryIMUv1 and BerryIMUv2 are supported
#
#    BerryIMUv1 uses LSM9DS0 IMU
#    BerryIMUv2 uses LSM9DS1 IMU
#
     #This program includes a number of calculations to improve the
#    values returned from BerryIMU. If this is new to you, it
#    may be worthwhile first to look at berryIMU-simple.py, which
#    has a much more simplified version of code which would be easier
#    to read.
#
#    This script is python 2.7 and 3 compatible
#
#    Feel free to do whatever you like with this code.

Here is an example:
magXmin =  -1748
magYmin =  -1025
magZmin =  -1876
magXmax =  959
magYmax =  1651
magZmax =  708
Dont use the above values, these are just an example.
